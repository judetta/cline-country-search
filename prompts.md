# First prompt

@/countries/src/app/app.component.html @/countries/src/app/app.component.ts : Replace the Angular boilerplate code (replace everything in the HTML page). I want to create a search UI for countries. This will have a text field for country name, and a 'search' button. The search results should simply contain a list of common names of the countries returned by the back end.

# Second Prompt

Please add the image of each country's flag in front of the country's name in the search results. This flag should be 50 px high.
